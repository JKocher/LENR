# Open-Source Sonoluminescence LENR Reactor

Welcome to the open-source LENR reactor project—a public effort to explore the possibility of designing and developing an intrinsically safe Low Energy Sonoluminescence Reactor with **no radioactive materials** involved.

This project provides a **starting point for researchers and engineers** interested in low energy nuclear reactions (LENR), sonoluminescence, and cavitation-based energy systems.

## What’s Inside

This repository contains (or will eventually contain):

- **3D CAD Models** – A spherical reactor core design with hemispherical aluminum horns and water chamber.
- **Materials & Colloid Recipes** – Starting concentrations for nickel powder, neutron moderators, and optional gain media.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** – Components for building your own test reactor.
- **FEA Simulations** – Helmholtz equation acoustic modeling using Elmer FEM to analyze pressure wave behavior in the reactor cavity.
- **Python Utilities** – Scripts for basic simulation, data logging, and future control loop automation.
- **Sensor Placement and Strategy** – Photodiode-based Bremsstrahlung detection setup and flow diagram.
- **Experimental Protocols** – Concepts for safe and reproducible LENR experimentation.

## Project Goals

- Build a **low-cost, modular sonoluminescence reactor** that supports LENR experimentation.
- Enable community collaboration with **open-source hardware and software**.
- Establish **prior art and reproducibility benchmarks** for LENR systems.
- Provide a **data-driven experimental framework** focused on detecting anomalous heating, not rare nuclear events.
